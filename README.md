## ðŸ’¡ What is SimpEngine?

**SimpEngine** is a lightweight, fan-made app that helps a user create a thoughtful date/event for their *simp target* â€” a person they want to invite.

Event creation is **step-by-step**:
- Each step (Drinks â†’ Entertainment â†’ Food â†’ Desserts â†’ Outfits â†’ â€¦) includes predefined options like:
  - **Entertainment:** movies, hiking, karting, skiing, painting  
  - **Food:** sushi, Italian, street food, fine dining  
- Users can also add **custom steps** with their own icons/images.

When the event is ready, the app generates a **special invite link** that the target opens to choose between the creatorâ€™s options.  
The creator then sees the targetâ€™s selection in their dashboard.

SimpEngine also provides **event management**, **target invites**, and **analytics**.

This repo contains the **client side** of the project â€” a fully featured **Next.js + TypeScript** application with modular architecture, powered by:
- ðŸ§  TanStack Query  
- ðŸª¶ React Hook Form + Zod  
- ðŸŽ¨ shadcn/ui
